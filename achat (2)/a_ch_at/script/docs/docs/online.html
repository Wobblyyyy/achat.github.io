      online list

    </h1>
    <p>
      the online list is shown in the right side of the chat menus. it lists all of the currently
      online users. there's a total of 3 colors that a user's name can be displayed in, and they all have different meanings
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">username</p>
      a bold username indicates that the user is currently typing. typing is defined by the message box having 2 or more characters
      written in it. please note that typing may still display if the user unloads the page without sending a message.
      <p style="color:black;">username</p>
      a black username means that the user has the chat box focused. this means that they have
      clicked inside of the chat box, not the home page. switching tabs or clicking the homepage
      will deactive this label.
      <p style="color:darkgray;">username</p>
      a dark gray username indicates that the user is online. this means that the page has not been unloaded - so either
      they're on a different tab, their computer is on sleep, or i fucked up the code.
