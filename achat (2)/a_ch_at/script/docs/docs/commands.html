    <p>
      a_ch_at has a few built in commands. here is a list of all of them and their functionality
      <h1>formatting</h1>
      fomatting for commands is bitchy because I'm lazy and don't feel like writing more code so your
      bitch ass can get lazy with typing commands. every command starts with a "." and commands that take
      options are case sensitive and shit, so yeah, pay attention, buddy
      <h2>.printraw</h2>
      shows raw printing of inbound messages. as in no formatting, so it's hard to read. pretty much only used for
      debugging or pretending you're cool, which you are cool if you use this fantastic website, soooooo
      <h2>.help</h2>
      does absolutely fucking nothing for now, until I make it do stuff
