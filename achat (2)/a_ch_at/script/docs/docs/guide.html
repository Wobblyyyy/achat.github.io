      <h2>authentication</h2>
      <h3>creating an account</h3>
      creating an account is as simple as clicking on the register hyperlink on the main screen and entering some information.
      in case you're actually retarded and can't read, the order for what you have to enter is EMAIL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, REPEAT PASSWORD.
      after you enter that shit in, you finna click the sign up button and it'll create your account. if you have any difficulty go yell at me.
      <p style="color:red;">
        no human will ever read your password - it's all SHA256 encrypted <br>
        YOUR EMAIL CAN NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE (1) "@" or "." CHARACTER
      </p>
      <h3>signing in to your account</h3>
      signing in to your account is equally simple. you just go to the log in page, and it'll prompt you
      to enter your username or email and password. note that if you go to the sign in page and are automatically redirected to the homepage,
      you're already signed in, in which case you can read the next subheader for signing out. you can be signed in
      to your account on however many computers you want, although I wouldn't suggest that
      <h3>logging out of your account</h3>
      if you for some reason want to log out of your account, go to the homepage, hover over your username in the top right, and click
      on the dropdown button that says "log out" or something like that. it'll redirect you to the basic-ass deauth page,
      and when you get there, you just click the button that says "log out" and you're all gucci
      <h2>homepage</h2>
      <h3>left-handed sidebar</h3>
      the left-handed sidebar displays a list of all of your conversations. as of now, it's
      not doing that because I'm retarded and don't feel like fixing it. when the sidebar is
      operational, it'll display (in order of most recent messages) all of the conversations
      you're a part of.
      <h3>top navigational bar</h3>
      just basic navigation options. you have HOMEPAGE (the page you're on) OPTIONS (to configure your client)
      and your username listed in the top right, which provides a drop down menu and some other shit.
      <h3>embedded chat boxes</h3>
      embedded chat boxes are literally what it sounds like - the huge chat box in the middle of your screen. what's on it 
      isn't controlled by the homepage, so I'll shut the fuck up about said homepage.
      <h2>chat pages</h2>
      <a href="online.html">also see: online list</a>
      <h3>loading</h3>
      when you open a chat, it'll load up to 100 previous messages. please know that you have no way of accessing messages past that.
      <h3>uploading</h3>
      pressing the enter key while focused on the typing box will upload whatever message you have to the server.
      messages less than 3 characters or greater than 1000 characters will not be downloaded and will not appear on your screen.
      <h3>printing messages</h3>
      every new message is added as a seperate element. after a few thousand messages your client may lag and it's suggested you refresh the page.
      <h3>message trimming</h3>
      messages more than 100 old will automatically be deleted as you upload more messages. this is to prevent me having to pay
      for this shit because im a broke ass.
