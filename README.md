# ACHAT v1
This is the very first version of achat which was officially and publically released.
Since then, new versions of achat dependent on entirely different frameworks and codebases have been created
and this is now antiquidated. Other versions of achat are all available on my GitHub page. I'm just keeping this up here so
in 5 years I can look back at it and laugh at how awful all of my code was.
